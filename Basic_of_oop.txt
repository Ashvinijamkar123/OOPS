## what is oop?
# ans:Object-oriented programming in python is a programming paradigm that uses objects,which are instance of classes,to organize code.In python,everything is an object,and OOP allows you to structure your code in a way that models real-world entitiees and their interactions.
"""
## What is class?
ans:1) Class is a blurprint to construct an object.
    2) It is an imaginary/logical entity.
    3) It does not require memory for execution.

## what is an object?
ans:1) An object is an instance of class.
    2) It is an physical/real-world entity.
    3) It requires memory for execution.
    4) Object have attributes(properties) and methods(behavior).
    syntax:
    ref_var=ClassName()

## what is reference variable?
ans: Reference variable is used to access functionalies of an object.

## How to create class?
ans:1) class is created by using 'class' keyword followed by an class name.
    2) syntax:
       class ClassName:
            #body

## Attribute:Variables that store data within a class.
There re three types of attributes
1) instance variable:
-instance variable are object level variable.
-instance variable are defined in constructor or method using self.
-Its value is different for each object.
-If value of one attribute is updated,it does not affect another attribute value.
- They can be access using object reference only.

2) class/static variable:
-class/static variables are class level variables.
-they are defined in class and outside of any method.
-its value is same,common for all objects.
-it can share object data
-if value of one attribute is udated,it affect another object.
-They can be access using object reference as well as class name but recommended for use classname.

3) Local variables:
- They are method level variables.
- they can be used only in specific method.
- they can be access using object reference.
